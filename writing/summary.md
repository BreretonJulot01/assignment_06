### Summary of article (200 words):

Technology can be used for good and for bad. Technology in general in today’s society can do harm in many aspects in many different ways. In this paper, I will be focusing on one specific technology which is drones. The most common way that drones are used is to capture photos of things. For example, if someone wants to take a wider view picture of a big area, they will send a drone in the air and the drone will capture the full area. This would be most useful at big sporting events or to capture big areas of land on camera. Drones could also be used for surveillance which leads me right into why drones could be used in a negative way. Although surveillance through drones could be a good way to use drones, it also creates a problem. By watching people through drones, you are also invading their privacy. Privacy can be invaded this way by the government or it could be your peers around you using drones to survey over you and watch you. In the beginning, drones were thought to be something that could be helpful and a way to make jobs easier for us to do. Drones should be used to make surveillance easier. They should be used to make taking photos and film making easier. They should be used in science to help explore new areas of the world and in outer space. They should be used to transport important things like medicine, packages, and food.
